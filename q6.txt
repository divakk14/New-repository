1 - variable a won't change because the func is being called as call by value. when this func is called, the copy of a variable will be passed and the changes are done to the copy not to original variable. 
2 - value will change because a mutuable obj is being passed to a func, this is passed as a call by reference meaning that the value which is passed will refer to the same location of the original obj 
due to which modifications inside the func will be reflected to the original obj as well.
